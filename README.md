PointCoin Chrome Extension : Remembar 
=========================

To encourage the spread of Pointcoin by providing an easier way to spend and share Pointcoins.  


Goals:


What do we do?

1. Create fast access to your public address

                                 input: Shorthand command, Public Address
                                 
                                 output: When shorthand command is typed, Remembar changes the command to your Public Address


2. Generate a unique QR code: 

                                input-> Address, Message, Amount

                                output->Output: unique QR code


Uses:
1. Sharing Address Online (Transactions, Forms, etc)
    -mistake free
2. Transactions in-store
    -Seller generates the QR, buyer reads the code and only has to confirm payment to block chain
    -Mobile, Convenient


Trusting Us:

Whatâ€™s stopping us from generating a wrong QR code? How come you don't send more than the desired amount? Or send the money to YOUR address?
  
    We do not handle the transaction.  No private keys, just a more convenient way to transact.  Verify your public keys at any time.
    
How we got here and challenges:

We originally began working on a redit bot that would be able to automatically send PointCoin to users. Our goal here was to spread awareness of PointCoin to others. After attempting to create a reddit bot, we began to understand that this would be beyond the scope of this project. Our work on the reddit bot was fruitless because we did not have a full grasp of the reddit API and how to properly communicate with it or set up a server for this. 


Instead, we decided to pivot our idea while keeping the same goal of spreading awareness of PointCoin. This led us to implement a Google Chrome extension. 

Where we want to go next:

We would like to see this used to do more complex tasks related to PointCoin. New features would allow for users to more easily use and share PointCoin.
