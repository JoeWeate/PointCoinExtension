PointCoin Chrome Extension : Remembar 
=========================

To encourage the spread of Pointcoin by providing an easier way to spend and share Pointcoins.  


Goals:


What do we do?
1. Create fast access to your public address 
                                 input: Shorthand command, Public Address
                                 output: When shorthand command is typed, Remembar changes the command to your Public Address


2. Generate a unique QR code: 
                                input-> Address, Message, Amount
                                output->Output: unique QR code


Uses:
1. Sharing Address Online (Transactions, Forms, etc)
    -mistake free
2. Transactions in-store
    -Seller generates the QR, buyer reads the code and only has to confirm payment to block chain
    -Mobile, Convenient


Trusting Us:
Whatâ€™s stopping us from generating a wrong QR code?
  How come you don't send more than the desired amount? Or send the money to YOUR address?
  
  We do not handle the transaction.  No private keys, just a more convenient way to transact.
